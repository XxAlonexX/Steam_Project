# 🎮 Not-Steam Store: A Flutter-powered Gaming Paradise

Welcome to Not-Steam, where we totally didn't copy Steam's homework but made it look different enough so the teacher won't notice! 

## 🚀 What's This All About?

It's like Steam, but with more Flutter and less Gabe Newell. We've got:

- 🎯 Games you can't actually buy (yet)
- 💨 Smooth animations that make your GPU feel useful
- 🌈 A dark theme because we're gamers and we hate light
- 🛒 A shopping cart that won't judge your gaming choices
- 📱 Cross-platform support (because gaming shouldn't be platform-ist)

## 🎨 Features That Make Us "Unique"

- **Featured Games Carousel**: Like Tinder, but for games
- **Special Offers**: Because who doesn't love discounts on things they don't need?
- **Responsive Design**: Looks good on everything from your smartwatch to your smart fridge
- **Modern UI**: We spent hours making it look like we spent days

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: Because native development is so 2010
- **Dart**: The language that makes Java developers feel at home
- **Provider**: State management that doesn't make you cry
- **Your Hopes & Dreams**: The most important ingredient

## 🚀 Getting Started

Made with ❤️ and excessive caffeine by someone who probably should be playing games instead of cloning Steam

Remember: In case Valve asks, you didn't see anything... 👀
